# Spam Email Classifier

This project is a spam email classifier built with Python and TensorFlow. It uses a neural network model to classify emails as either 'spam' or 'ham' (not spam).

## Features

- Preprocessing: The project includes functions for removing stop words and normalizing text.
- Word Embedding: The model uses an Embedding layer for word representation.
- Neural Network: The model is a neural network with Dense layers and uses the 'relu' activation function.
- Evaluation: The project includes code for evaluating the model using accuracy, loss, and AUC metrics.

## Requirements

- Python (3.10.4)
- TensorFlow
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Run `main.py` to train the model.
4. Run `test.py` or `test2.py` to test the model on new emails.
